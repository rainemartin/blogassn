				Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power
				derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. On second thoughts, let's not go there.
				It is a silly place. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
				Shut up! Will you shut up?! What do you mean? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!
				I'm not a witch. Did you dress her up like this? â€¦Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? The Knights Who Say Ni demand
				a sacrifice! Bring her forward! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water!
				I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before
				I am forced to taunt you a second time! Now, look here, my good man. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
				Help, help, I'm being repressed! Burn her anyway! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms,
				sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English
				K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
