			   Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
			   I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I hate yogurt.
			   It's just stuff with bits in. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke,
			   tell me what normal blokes do! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!
			   Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!
			   I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match,
			   didn't you? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too.
			   I still don't know why. You've swallowed a planet! Saving the world with meals on wheels.

			   I'm partial to air conditioning. I like seafood. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.
			   Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I love Halloween.
			   The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.
